Error types in Computer Science 
- Syntax error – diagnosed by assembler/compiler !
- Run-time error (execution error) – program crashes – it stops executing 
- Logical error = program runs until its end or remains blocked in an 
infinite loop … if it functions until its end, it functions LOGICALLY 
WRONG obtaining totally different results/output then the envisioned 
ones 
- Fatal: Linking Error !!! (for example in the case of a variable defined 
multiple times in a multimodule program … if we have 17 modules, a 
variable must be defined ONLY in a SINGLE module ! If it is defined in 
2 or more modules , a “Fatal: Linking Error !!! – Duplicate definition for 
symbol ….” will be obtained

CF(Carry flag) -> is the transport flag and it will be set to 1 if int the last LPO there was a carry outside the representation domain

CF --> signals the unsigned overflow



OF(Overflow flag)---> signals the signed overflow. If the result of the last performed LPO(considered in signed interpretation) didn t fit the reserved space, then
the flag is set to 1 and set to 0 otherwise

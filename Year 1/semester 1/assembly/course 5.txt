mov eax,[ebx + esp]

esp can only be a base register in any order s - source ---> is a base

offset spec = [base] + [index * scale] + [constant]



don t forget about little endian -- the last byte is the first in the memory



[] ---- direct adressing





i) immediate mode
ii) register mode
iii) memorry addresing mode



In any programming language any declared variable will have a fixed adress but moreover it's offset is always a constant determinable at assembly or compiled time

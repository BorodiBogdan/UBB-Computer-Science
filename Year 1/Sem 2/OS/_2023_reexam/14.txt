What will the fragment below print? Justify your answer.

execl("expr", "expr", "1", "+", "1", NULL);
execlp("echo", "echo", "3", NULL);
printf("4\n");

solution:

error because we need to specify the full path bin/expr, not the file name, after that the program will continue working and will print 3, since pritf 4 won't  be executed because the program image will change
